# HPC using MacBook

This project attempts using my MacBook Pro's abilities to perform parallel computation.
The aim is to look at optimising computation using CPU and GPU abilities on scientific calculations, 
such as Machine Learning Regressor, Advection equation, and Fast-Fourier Transforms.

## MacBook specs
This is a MacBook Pro 2021 with the following specs:
**Apple MacBook Pro M1 chip**
- 8-core CPU with 6 performance cores and 2 efficiency cores
- 14-core GPU
- 16-core Neural Engine
- 16GB unified memory

## Use of parallel computing
Use of parallel computing using CPU by -
- MPI multithreading
- OpenMP

Use of GPU acceleration -
- Using Appleâ€™s framework for GPU-accelerated compute tasks - Metal Performance Shaders (MPS)

## Programming Language
C++, Objective-C++
